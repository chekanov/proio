# About
Java-proio is currently incomplete.  Only read and dereferencing capabilities
are implemented.

# Building
Building the code requires Maven.
```shell
mvn install
```

# Running the "Ls" tool
This is a tool that serves as an example for a browser tool.  This one is
simple and only dumps text to the terminal.
```shell
java -cp target/proio-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar proio.Ls ../samples/smallSample.proio | less
```

# Examples 
Please see [the main readme](../README.md).
